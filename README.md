# Sunshine Expo Template

This is a quickstart template I made with the stack I use for my personal projects.

## Background

For the last 6 months I have tried to start a new side project a whole bunch of times, on my own and with friends. It's always time-consuming to startup a project and setting a foundation, especially setting up authentication, routing and form handling. I wanted to create a template that has a basic but solid setup so that I can focus on my main project and not lose motivation early on due to these things.

I've made templates before and I know that they easily get outdated without commitment. My thought was that this is a solid setup for my upcoming projects for this year at least.

## Stack

Base: Latest Expo setup with SDK 53, React-Native 0.79 and React 19.0.0.

- Nativewind for styling
- [RNR-Primitives](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/introduction/) for UI components (The shadcn of React native). The components are a bit lacking but it's a great tool for quick starts and it's easy to customize if you want to.
- Supabase for authentication and database
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Zod for type validation
- Tanstack Query for data fetching
- i18next & react-i18next for internationalization

## TODO

I wish to keep adding small improvements without being too opinionated. I do enjoy trying new tools in each side project, so I'm trying to keep this minimal.

- [ ] Add more routing examples
- [ ] Add gesture handling examples
- [ ] Add basic formatting utils
- [ ] Add my favorite Eslint rules
